This project involves a Windows Forms application designed to create and display player
information using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application
utilizes a `Player` class to encapsulate player details and provides a user-friendly
interface to input and showcase data.

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of OOP
concepts in C#. The application allows users to create players by entering their 
first name, last name, health, and power level. These details are encapsulated
within the `Player` class, which features a constructor for object initialization
and a method to generate a player greeting.
